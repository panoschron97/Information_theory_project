I wrote code in java reading three .txt files in three different languages and with
the help of a menu the following functions are performed.

Menu functions:

1. Read file.
2. Character calculation.
3. Calculation of the probability distribution.
4. Calculation of the entropy of the distribution.
5. Counting the number of resulting pairs.
6. Calculation of the distribution in pairs of adjacent characters.
7. Calculation of common entropy.
8. Calculation of conditional entropy.
9. Generate fixed code length per character in text.
10. Generate a fixed code length per character pair in the text.
11. Create Shannon-Fano encoding.
